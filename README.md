# MfGames Writing - Make Build System

This build system is written to use the tools of `mfgames-writing` and other common Linux applications to create the file formats frequently used in writing. It is capable of going from Creole or Markdown to Microsof Word, OpenOffice.org/Libreoffice, PDF (via `xelatex`), HTML, ePUB, and Mobi (via `kindlegen`).
